# Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Prediction
Project
In this Poject I have used machine learning algorithms which is LSTM model because it give awesome result on time series data.
Before that I have done detailed EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis).
After model building I have also done Sentiment Analysis to know the next day market sentiment either it will be positive or Negative.
Then integrated everything and deploye using Streamlit.
app.py is the final work.
